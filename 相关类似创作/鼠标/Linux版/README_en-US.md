## About

- **Original Author**: [Bilibili @1013625945 (漓翎_cub)](https://space.bilibili.com/1013625945)
- **Ported by**: [GitHub @Tseshongfeeshur (Ryan)](https://github.com/Tseshongfeeshur)

As of the project’s release date (2025-12-06), the original author has only provided versions for Windows and macOS. Since no [GNU](https://www.gnu.org/)/[Linux](https://kernel.org/) version was available, this theme has been ported into an [XDG cursor theme package](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/icon-theme/latest/) that works with most [GNU](https://www.gnu.org/)/[Linux](https://kernel.org/) desktop environments. **Great thanks to the original author — without his work, this port would not exist, and we wouldn’t be able to enjoy such a beautiful cursor theme.**

## Project Content

- Based on the character **“Hei”** from the series [*The Legend of Hei*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Hei), designed and created by **[漓翎_cub](https://space.bilibili.com/1013625945)**
- **Mostly** animated cursors
- Supports **24 / 32 / 48 / 64 / 96 / 128 / 192 / 256 / 512** pixel resolutions

## Supported Targets

- All [GNU](https://www.gnu.org/)/[Linux](https://kernel.org/) desktop environments that support [XDG cursor themes](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/icon-theme/latest/)
  - Fully tested and works well under [KDE Plasma](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/) and [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/)

## Installation

We recommend installing the pre-built package, so build-from-source installation steps are not provided here. Only the installation steps using the pre-built package are included.

If you prefer to build and install it yourself, please use the build script located in the `sources` directory. That script can directly generate the theme folder. Arch Linux users can install the AUR package `hei-cursors-git`.

### Arch Linux

#### Install with an AUR helper

```zsh
paru -S hei-cursors-bin
```

**Or**, using any other AUR helper you prefer:
```zsh
yay -S hei-cursors-bin
```

#### Install the AUR package manually

```zsh
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/hei-cursors-bin.git
cd hei-cursors-bin
makepkg -si
```

**Or**, install manually **(not recommended, as `pacman` will not track the package)**.

## Other Distributions (Manual Installation)

- Debian
  ```zsh
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install curl tar
  ```

- Fedora
  ```zsh
  sudo dnf install curl tar

## Applying the Cursor Theme

   ```zsh
   systemsettings kcm_cursortheme
   ```

2. Select the "**Hei**" cursor theme and click "**Apply**"
3. Choose a cursor size that feels comfortable

### GNOME

1. Install `gnome-tweaks`
   - Debian
     ```zsh
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install gnome-tweaks
     ```

     ```zsh
     sudo dnf install gnome-tweaks

3. Select the "**Hei_cursor**" cursor theme from the dropdown list
4. Optionally adjust the cursor size via command line:
   ```zsh
   gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface cursor-size $px
   # Replace $px with your desired size, e.g. 48
   ```
